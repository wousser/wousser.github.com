          <h3>Client</h3>
<p>
  Client is the leading global information and communications technology (ICT) solutions provider. Offering network infrastructure, application and software, professional services and devices to telecommunication operators, enterprises and consumers worldwide.</p>

        <h3>My Role</h3>

        <p>I worked on this project as Lead User Experience Designer. I am leading the UX design work, supervising six members: interaction designers, visual designers and user research. Making decisions through consultations with Business Analysts, Visual Designers and Developers. I worked on this project for three years, from conceptual design till global launch.
        </p>

        <h3>Challenge</h3>
        <p>
        In order to continue its streamlining global service delivery operation, client needed to have an end-to-end integrated IT platform to support its field project delivery, alignment between pre-sales solution and post-sales delivery, as well as clear ERP and acceptance criteria during the delivery stage. To achieve this, client was determined to transform its service delivery operation through building a field project manager centric delivery platform.
                </p>
        <p>
          Over the years, enterprise staff at the client got used to working with spreadsheets to input and edit data, and communicated by email and phone calls, which led to inefficiency, increased data input errors and multiple sources of truth. Also enterprise employees have come to expect consumer-level experience in all the applications they use.</p>
<p>
The project’s challenge is to design a platform that helps all users get their tasks done easier, more efficient and without error. Another challenge is to approach an enterprise project with a user-centered design approach instead of a functional design approach
that the client is accustomed to. Our personal challenge is to defend and explain our design decisions against a lot Business Analysts from different disciplines and departments from across the world.

<h3>Discovery</h3>
<p>
What we can tell from the projects background:
<ul>
  <li>
    Massive Information Architecture
  </li>
  <li>
    Excel-like page layouts
  </li>
  <li>
    Unclear definition of user profiles
  </li>
  <li>
    A lot of user feedback
  </li>
</ul>
What we want to know:
<ul>
  <li>
    Who uses the system? How will they use the system?
  </li>
  <li>
    What is their preference?
  </li>
  <li>
    What do they currently like / don't like?
  </li>
</ul>
What we will deliver:
<ul>
  <li>
    High level design strategy
  </li>
  <li>
    Better understanding user behavior and context of use
  </li>
  <li>
    New conceptual design
  </li>
</ul>
</p>

<h3>Benchmarking</h3>
<p>
  Before we dive into the design work, we chose to benchmark using four UX design indicators: UX Strategy, Information Architecture, Interaction Design and Visual Representations. Then we chose several project management and teamwork products to compare to. They all represent best practices in their industries. With these results, we get to know how to target the platform for this project.

<h3>Key User Roles</h3>
<p>
  According to the business, we identified 8 key roles that will be using this system the most, which are:
</p>
<img class="telecomcasestudy small center" src="img/telecommunications/Roles.png" alt="" title="" />

<h3>Personas</h3>
<p>
  After interviewing a large number of users, we generated personas for each role, which were later used in making design decisions.
</p>
<img class="telecomcasestudy" src="img/telecommunications/Persona.png" alt="" title="" />

<p>
  Getting to know better their routine work in a full-cycle helped a lot of well. Pictured below is one of the flows a user encounters on a daily basis.
</p>
<img class="telecomcasestudy" src="img/telecommunications/Userflow.png" alt="" title="" />


<h3>Field study</h3>
<p>
  Field studies were conducted to better understand the front-line workers, who are one of the most important users of the system. These users are also the source of all data in the system. Observing and interviewing them on site, while they are doing their job offered us excellent insights and information. We used this to compile scenarios, task flows and reports about all users and their interactions with the system.

<h3>Personalized Dashboard Design</h3>

<h3>User Journey</h3>
<p>
  Inspired by user research, a user journey map was created for different roles at different project stages.

<h3>Information Architecture</h3>
<img class="telecomcasestudy" src="img/telecommunications/IA.png" alt="" title="" />

<h3>Wireframes</h3>
<p>
  In order to visualize business requirements and user flows, wireframes were designed together with BA's for every system module.
</p>

<img class="telecomcasestudy" src="img/telecommunications/wireframe1.png" alt="" title="" />

<h3>Design Guidelines</h3>
<p>
Because the system includes a lot of different modules and pages, there are a lot of reusable components and widgets. To maintain consistency for users and developers, we created guidelines for all common elements of the interface. From simple buttons and icons to more complex interactions such as input forms, dialogs and tables. These guidelines became the backbone of the system, and save a lot of time for BA, developers and for us designers.
</p>

<img class="telecomcasestudy" src="img/telecommunications/Guidelines.png" alt="" title="" />

<h3>Mobile</h3>
<p>
One important insight from our research was that the majority of the frontline engineers doesn't take a laptop with them when to carry out the field work. Because of this it was decided that a mobile version should be created that would allow the engineers to use the most important functions of the system.
</p>

<img class="telecomcasestudy" src="img/telecommunications/Mobile.png" alt="" title="" />
<h3>Usability Testing</h3>
<p>
  After each sprint, we held a User Testing session where we pick a specific scenario to test. Based on the scenario users from various roles are recruited. A list of tasks is made by us and participants complete these while thinking aloud. Having participants think aloud provides a wealth of qualitative data into the thought processes and the potential causes of problems.
</p>
  <p>Usability testing was done at a testing lab equipped with a monitoring system. We monitored the users operating in another room through a screen capturing software to avoid being interruptive. We also paid attention to the users' facial expression through another camera.
</p>
  <p>All sessions are recorded and the findings are reported to the PM and solutions to solve problems find their way as stories into the next sprint.
</p>

<h3>Agile Development</h3>
<p>
  This project used agile development methodology to define project features. By focusing features based on the needs of the uses, it provided the opportunity to test after each sprint, gathering valuable feedback early in the process and providing the ability to make quick changes as needed.
</p>
<img class="telecomcasestudy" src="img/telecommunications/Agile.png" alt="" title="" />
<h3>Localization</h3>
<p>
  This project is used worldwide, so during the design phase we always designed for users from all over the world. Special focus was put on timezones, local formatting of dates, currency and metrics.
</p>

<h3>Impact</h3>
<p>
  “After years of effort, we have put in place a more streamlined delivery process, the ISDP, greatly improving delivery efficiency and quality.” <i>CEO</i>
