<p>Wouter bron practices User Experience for over three years. He started at the users side carrying out usability studies and user observation. He worked as an interaction designer and created the popular mobile game Happy Fish.  Currently managing User Experience of big e-commerce projects. </p>
<p>An experienced UX designer working three years in the field. Projects (both small and big) include ecommerce, mobile, and games. Solving complex problems with the user in mind using my broad skillset including Interaction Design, Usability Engineering and my technical background.</p>
<p>What are three things a hiring manager would want to know about you? How long have you been working in UX? What platforms or types of products have you designed for? What are your strengths as a designer? Do you derive great insight from research? Are you an IA genius? Are you able to code the front-end aspects of what you design?</p>
<p>//3 projects.</p>

<p>main body of work</p>
<p>conclusion</p>
<p>Key takeaways</p>
<p>//Do you have photos of white boards with rainbows of post-its across them? Sketches of initial wires? Personas you’ve created? Annotated wireframes? Show them to us!</p>
<p>//Show initial sketches from your design book. Show your first iteration of wireframes or process flows. Was detailed information architecture part of your process? Show that too.</p>
<p>//As you guide the user through your process, talk about the challenges, hiccups, and speed bumps that popped up along the way. These random curve balls are often the elements that are harnessed to make a good project great.
Close with an image of the final deliverable (if possible). Be sure to note who did the visual design/coding if that wasn’t you.</p>
<h3 id="interaction-design">Interaction Design</h3>
<p>I create detailed UI specifications for all product features to match the users expectations. I work together with Product Managers, Graphic Designers and Developers to create sketches, wireframes, flow diagrams, etc to help teams understand the designs and assist them during implementation.</p>
<h3 id="user-experience">User Experience</h3>
<p>An Ethnographic study of the Out Of Box Experience of a new mobile phone to understand the 1st hour/1st day/1st week and 1st month customer experience of using a new mobile phone.
In this project I visited the users at their home and observed their phone setup process. Followed up on the users experiences for a one month period and moderated focus group sessions.</p>
<p>Worked together with two remote researchers who conducted the same project in UK and Greece at the same time.</p>
<h3 id="intranet-usability">Intranet Usability</h3>
<p>Interaction Designer, Usability Specialist</p>
<p>Optimizing a corporate Intranet. The new Intranet should stimulate the ease of navigation, information retrieval and ensure a smooth online experience within and across different segment of users.</p>
<p>In this project I was responsible for Customer Research, Requirements Gathering, Wireframe and Prototype design and development. Worked together with a colleague to create and conduct the surveys and interviews. I created the Wireframes and Prototypes, each iteration was reviewed by an expert.</p>
<h3 id="prototyping">Prototyping</h3>
<p>To keep up with all the new web technology I took the opportunity to create a small game at the Beijing TechCrunch Hackaton. This game helps students to practice a language. Ten players answer questions in real-time, and the top 3 will advance to the next level.</p>
<p>This prototype is build on the Node.js framework, and uses the Foundation framework so it can be played on any device (Desktop and Mobile).</p>
